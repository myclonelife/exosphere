__Exosphere makes micro-services easy and fun__

Exosphere is a high-level framework
for building, testing, deploying, operating, and evolving
a wide variety of cloud, mobile, and IoT application ecosystems.
With unparalleled productivity and fun,
out of polyglot micro-services.

## Business benefits

__lower cost and risk__ of development, operation, and maintenance.
- Quickly put together prototypes
  out of pre-existing back-end and UI components,
  and evolve them into production-grade applications over time
  without The Big Rewrite.
- many of the difficult things are heavily automated
- Exosphere is open, free, and extensible
- you can reuse up to 80% of the code for one application in other applications,
  independent of which stack they use.
  This means lower risk because even if an investment fails,
  large parts of the developed technology can be used in other projects,
  and new projects are much faster and cheaper to build out of pre-existing components

__use a wider variety of engineering talent__ for productive engineering and devops.
Current technology stacks and code bases are so complicated
that only the top 10-20% of engineering talent can work on them
with a high chance of success.
Exosphere breaks down code bases and complexity to levels
that allow even less experienced engineers to create good enough code
under the supervision of experienced tech leadership.
You also need less specialized Ops personnel because Exosphere provides
very powerful and easy to use devops tools.

scale up your business and IT operations and sustain higher level of development velocity and code quality,
because complexity and technical debt are better contained into micro-services,
and many best practices are built into and enforced by the framework


Benefits for tech people:
- use micro-services in a way that works,
  because the stack is designed from the ground up for them
- leading-edge high-tech,
  packaged into a toolkit that is optimized for
  human ergonomics, productivity, and delight.

- the framework goes the extra mile for its users
  by automating the boilerplate
- offer highly productive, opinionated conventions on top of a generic foundation

- develop against explicit
  functional, performance, security, and reliability requirements<sup>&#42;</sup>
- data-center aware, runs on top of public and private cloud environments
  like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com),
  [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com),
  [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com),
  [DCOS](https://dcos.io), etc<sup>&#42;</sup>
- marketplace for reusable services<sup>&#42;</sup>
