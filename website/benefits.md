# Benefits

This page outlines more details about how Exosphere can make sense for you.

### Business benefits

__lower cost and risk__ of development, operation, and maintenance.

Exosphere allows you to quickly develop and launch functionaly prototypes
and evolve them into production-grade applications
without the dreaded Big Rewrite.

You start by plugging together pre-existing back-end and UI components like Lego bricks,
customize the UI, and get to market.
As you grow and refine your business,
you can productize or replace generic components with custom-build ones
in a seamless way that does reduce technical debt in your code base.

You save cost because many of the currently difficult things
are heavily automated and can get done
by smaller teams with less training.
Your developers can reuse up to 80% of the code of one application in other applications.
This means lower risk because even if an investment fails,
large parts of the developed technology can be used in other projects,
and new projects are much faster and cheaper to build out of pre-existing components
And Exosphere is open, free, and extensible.

Current tech stacks and code bases are so complicated
that only the top 10-20% of the worldwide engineering talent can work on them
with a high chance of success.
Exosphere has a lot of best practices built in,
it breaks down code bases and complexity to levels
that allow even less experienced engineers to create good enough code
under the supervision of experienced tech leadership.
it automated many repetitive tasks,
and provides powerful and easy to use devops tools.
This means you need less specialized Ops personnel.

scale up your business and IT operations and sustain higher level of development velocity and code quality,
because complexity and technical debt are better contained into micro-services,
and many best practices are built into and enforced by the framework


Benefits for tech people:
- use micro-services in a way that works,
  because the stack is designed from the ground up for them
- leading-edge high-tech,
  packaged into a toolkit that is optimized for
  human ergonomics, productivity, and delight.

- the framework goes the extra mile for its users
  by automating the boilerplate
- offer highly productive, opinionated conventions on top of a generic foundation

- develop against explicit
  functional, performance, security, and reliability requirements<sup>&#42;</sup>
- data-center aware, runs on top of public and private cloud environments
  like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com),
  [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com),
  [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com),
  [DCOS](https://dcos.io), etc<sup>&#42;</sup>
- marketplace for reusable services<sup>&#42;</sup>
