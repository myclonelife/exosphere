# Benefits

This page provides more details how Exosphere can help you succeed.


### Business benefits

* __lower cost and risk__:
  Exosphere allows you to quickly develop and launch fully functional prototypes
  of cloud applications
  by plugging together existing front-end and back-end building blocks
  like Lego bricks.
  This allows you to iterate fast and try out many ideas.
  As your product solidifies and gains traction,
  you can gradually evolve these prototypes into production-grade applications
  without the dreaded [Big Rewrite](http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/2596/Why-You-Should-Almost-Never-Rewrite-Your-Software.aspx),
  and while keeping technical debt contained and manageable.

  You save cost because many of the currently difficult things
  are heavily automated and can get done
  by smaller teams with less training.
  Your developers can reuse up to 80% of the code of one application in other applications.
  This means lower risk because even if an investment fails,
  large parts of the developed technology can be used in other projects,
  and new projects are much faster and cheaper to build out of pre-existing components
  And Exosphere is open, free, and extensible.

Current tech stacks and code bases are so complicated
that only the top 10-20% of the worldwide engineering talent can work on them
with a high chance of success.
Exosphere has a lot of best practices built in,
it breaks down code bases and complexity to levels
that allow even less experienced engineers to create good enough code
under the supervision of experienced tech leadership.
it automated many repetitive tasks,
and provides powerful and easy to use devops tools.
This means you need less specialized Ops personnel.

scale up your business and IT operations and sustain higher level of development velocity and code quality,
because complexity and technical debt are better contained into micro-services,
and many best practices are built into and enforced by the framework


Benefits for tech people:
- use micro-services in a way that works,
  because the stack is designed from the ground up for them
- leading-edge high-tech,
  packaged into a toolkit that is optimized for
  human ergonomics, productivity, and delight.

- the framework goes the extra mile for its users
  by automating the boilerplate
- offer highly productive, opinionated conventions on top of a generic foundation

- develop against explicit
  functional, performance, security, and reliability requirements<sup>&#42;</sup>
- data-center aware, runs on top of public and private cloud environments
  like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com),
  [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com),
  [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com),
  [DCOS](https://dcos.io), etc<sup>&#42;</sup>
- marketplace for reusable services<sup>&#42;</sup>
